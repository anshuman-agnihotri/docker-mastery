## ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following ready:

- Docker installed and running.
- Docker Compose installed (`docker compose` or `docker-compose`).
- ARM64 or AMD64 architecture.
- An active internet connection.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- ❌ **Not supported on Windows or macOS** via Docker.
- 🚫 Only **one Fing Agent per device**.
- 🔄 **Migration from Snap to Docker is not supported**. You'll need to uninstall the Snap version first.

---

## 📦 Install via Docker Compose (Recommended)

This is the easiest and most automated way to run the Fing Agent.

### 🧰 Step-by-Step:

```bash
# Download the Docker Compose YAML
curl https://get.fing.com/fing-docker/compose.yaml -o compose.yaml

# Start the container in detached mode
docker compose up -d    # For Docker v2+
# OR
docker-compose up -d    # For older Docker versions
````

✅ This will:

* Download the latest Fing Agent image
* Run it as a background service
* Enable persistent volumes
* Use host network mode for full visibility

---

## 🛠 Manual Installation via Docker

Prefer the CLI? Here’s how:

```bash
sudo docker run --network=host --cap-add NET_ADMIN \
  --publish 44444:44444 -d --restart=always \
  --name FingAgent \
  -v fing-data-volume:/app/fingdata \
  fing/fing-agent:latest
```

📌 This setup:

* Uses host networking (needed for network scanning)
* Adds `NET_ADMIN` capabilities
* Publishes port `44444` (for UPnP status)
* Mounts volume for persistent data

---

## 🔄 Migrating from Snap (Optional)

If you have an existing Snap install:

1. **Deactivate** the Snap version in the Fing mobile app (long press > Deactivate)
2. Run the following to uninstall:

```bash
sudo snap remove fing-agent
```

3. Proceed with Docker installation as described above.

---

## ❌ Uninstallation

To stop and remove the Docker container:

```bash
docker stop FingAgent
docker rm FingAgent
```

To remove the volume:

```bash
docker volume rm fing-data-volume
```
